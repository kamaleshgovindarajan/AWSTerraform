What is Infrastructure as Code (IaC)?
Infrastructure as Code is the process of defining your entire cloud infrastructure — servers, databases, networks, IAM roles — using code instead of manually creating resources through the console.
Think of it as writing scripts for your infrastructure — scripts that can be version-controlled, tested, and automated.

Terraform simplifies cloud infrastructure by letting you:
Provision resources faster and consistently
Avoid manual errors in the cloud console
Version-control your infrastructure
Save cost by automating teardown (terraform destroy) when not needed

Without IaC:
Every change is manual and error-prone
Documentation drifts from the actual setup
Scaling becomes complex
Reproducibility is difficult (can’t replicate environments easily)
Terraform eliminates these issues by maintaining a consistent, declarative infrastructure model.

How Terraform Works
Terraform interacts with AWS (or any cloud) using API calls.
When you apply a Terraform configuration:
Terraform reads your .tf files
It connects with the cloud provider using credentials
It compares your desired state vs. current infrastructure
It provisions or updates resources accordingly
