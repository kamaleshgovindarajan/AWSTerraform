Terraform Provider — a crucial component that makes Terraform cloud-agnostic and powerful.

What is a Terraform Provider?
When you write your infrastructure code (.tf files), Terraform itself doesn’t know how to create an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket.
It’s the provider that translates your HCL code into actual API calls to the cloud provider.

Providers bridge the gap between Terraform and the cloud’s REST APIs.
Each provider comes with its own set of resources (like aws_vpc, aws_s3_bucket, aws_instance, etc.).
Terraform automatically downloads these providers during initialization using the terraform init command.

Types of Terraform Providers
Official- Managed by HashiCorp (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
Partner- Maintained by technology partners (e.g., Datadog, Cloudflare).
Community- Built and maintained by the Terraform community.

Versioning in Providers
Terraform keeps evolving, and so do providers.
If you don’t specify a version, Terraform will fetch the latest provider version, which can sometimes cause compatibility issues.
