Task 1: Understanding COUNT
Objective: Create two S3 buckets using a single resource block with count

Create a variable of type list(string) for bucket names
Use count to iterate through the bucket names
Reference bucket names using count.index
Run terraform plan to see the resources

variable.tf
variable "buckets" {
description = "values for s3 buckets"
type = list(string)
default = ["bucket-one-126543", "bucket-two-127543"]
}

main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bulb" {
  count = 3
  bucket = var.buckets[count.index]
}

---

Task 2: Understanding FOR_EACH
Objective: Create two S3 buckets using a single resource block with for_each

Create a variable of type set(string) for bucket names
Use for_each to iterate through the bucket names
Reference bucket names using each.value
Compare resource addressing: [0] vs ["bucket-name"]

variable.tf
variable "buckets_set" {
description = variable test for set"
type = set(string)
default = ["bucket-onekamu-126543", "bucket-twokamu-127543"]
}

main.tf
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "slip"
for_each = var.bucket_set
bucket = each.value
}

---
Task 3: Output with FOR Loop
Objective: Display bucket information using for expressions

Create output to print all bucket names using a for loop
Create output to print all bucket IDs using a for expression
Run terraform output to verify

output.tf
output "bucket_name" {
  value = [for b in aws_s3_bucket.bulb : b.bucket]
}
output "bucket_nameslip" {
  value = [for b in aws_s3_bucket.slip : b.bucket]
}

output "bucket_id" {
  value = [for b in aws_s3_bucket.bulb : b.id]
}
output "bucket_idslip" {
  value = [for b in aws_s3_bucket.slip : b.id]
}

On terraform plan
+ bucket_name     = [
      + "bucket-one-861861",
      + "bucket-one-861861",
      + "bucket-two-861861",
      + "bucket-three-861861",
      + "bucket-two-861861",
      + "bucket-three-861861",
      + "bucket-three-861861",
    ]
  + bucket_nameslip = [
      + "bucket-onekamu-861861",
      + "bucket-twokamu-861861",
      + "bucket-threekamu-861861",
    ]
  + bucket_idslip   = [
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply),
      + (known after apply)
